# Overboard

Example repo for using the library [use-flexible-undo](https://github.com/philipmendels/use-flexible-undo) together with an interactive board, built from scratch in React. Work in progress.

Play with the board [here](https://philipmendels.github.io/overboard/).

Functionality:

- multi-select (marquee or CMD / CTRL / SHIFT)
- add card (double-click board)
- remove cards (DEL / BACKSPACE)
- move cards
- scale cards
- reorder cards / change z-index
