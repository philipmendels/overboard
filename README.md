# Overboard

Example repo for using the library [use-flexible-undo](https://github.com/philipmendels/use-flexible-undo) together with an interactive board. The board itself is built from scratch in React. The list with draggable items / layers uses [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

Play with the board [here](https://philipmendels.github.io/overboard/).
